# QGAN

This project is a work in progress exploring natural language generation, in particular question generation, using GANs.

This is the code for a first pass at using the SQuAD data set to train a GAN to generate/discriminate questions of English.  See my blog post about this at https://www.jonscottstevens.com/updates-1/gander-at-gans
